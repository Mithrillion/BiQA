      "( @entity0 ) -- when we think of the perfect summer blockbuster , we think of action -- and july 's \" @entity5 \" will have more than enough , star @entity1 says . the 44 - year - old is back for another round as the ferocious mutant @entity8 , but @entity10 's take is somewhat darker than its predecessors . as the trailers have shown , the typically sly @entity8 appears to be in a pretty serious funk as he 's haunted by thoughts of @entity15 ( @entity16 ) . when a man whose life he once saved summons him to @entity20 , the ageless mutant is presented with an offer of mortality as a so - called expression of gratitude . \" he 's sort of interested in it , because if your life is not great and there is a lot of regret and pain , would it be great to live on and on ? \" @entity1 said of his character 's dilemma . and yet , as @entity5 hints in the trailer , the time has n't come where he has nothing left to live for . fans are anticipating seeing the iconic \" x-men \" character put up an intense fight against his foes -- part of which happens atop a bullet train , as previews have shown . \" the only bad thing about filming a scene on the bullet train is that the wind machines are so powerful that when you watch it back on the monitor , you 're like , ' man , i got to get a facelift because there 's just skin flying everywhere , ' \" @entity1 joked . \" when i was lying on that train , i would just get pushed back -- and a couple of times , i just fell off of the train . \" but , as a guy who loves the \" popcorn element \" of summer movies , he knows those sorts of action sequences are what audiences are hoping for . \" yes , ( ' the @entity5 ' ) is a character piece , and i would say it may be a little darker in tone than the others , and it certainly feels a little different , ( but ) it 's just as much fun , \" @entity1 said . \" the action is probably in this is more inventive than we 've ever had before . \" @entity0 's @entity76 spoke with @entity1 about how he bulked up once again , his character 's vulnerable side and why @entity5 makes a pretty solid wingman for a teen . @entity0 : looking at you , the only thing i can say is , \" @entity5 is back ! \" @entity1 : he 's back , and i could n't be happier . i never in a million years would 've thought ( that ) i 'd still be playing this character ( 12 years later ) . it kind of really is shocking to me , but at the same time , it 's such an instant gratitude , because i love this character . @entity0 : so you know him now , really know him ? @entity1 : i hope so . i feel like i do . i certainly feel proprietorial over him , and , you know , i have now read a lot of ( the ) comic books . being someone who had never read the comic books , when i first heard about the audition , i was like , ' they want me to play @entity98 ? ' who is the lead of this @entity101 rock band called the @entity102 . ... so i knew nothing . it 's been a great ride . @entity0 : this picks up after \" @entity107 , \" so we do know that @entity15 ( @entity16 ) has met her demise -- but i 've seen the trailers . she 's there ! @entity1 : i do n't want to give away too much . she is there in the way that loved ones are always there ... in a very real way , she 's there . @entity0 : is it safe to say that @entity5 , especially in this movie , is a little bit of a sensitive superhero ? @entity1 : he 's certainly more vulnerable . @entity0 : he 's a broken man , a bit . @entity1 : oh , yeah . i mean , @entity5 is the toughest superhero . i may be biased , but i think he 's the toughest . he does n't necessarily have the strongest powers on paper , but ... he 's the one guy who you do n't want to be on his bad side . in this movie , however , you kind of see the toll of that ; we start with him questioning everything . his life has been dominated by pain , by regret , mistakes ... @entity0 : he loses the love of his life . @entity1 : ( @entity143 ) loses the love of his life , ( and ) we 've seen that impact . he 's one of those people where whenever he gets close to someone , bad things tend to happen . so in a way , not only for himself but for the world , he decides to just completely go off the reservation and sort of deny who he is and be like a recluse . @entity0 : but there is something that 's bringing him back @entity1 : there is something bringing him back . ... he just ca n't help himself , you know ? i think the thing i love about him is , you know , he 's reluctant , he does n't want to get involved , he 's not an idealist , but at the end of the day when there is an injustice , he ca n't help but rise to the occasion . @entity0 : he 's such a great character . ( playing him ) had to raise the cool factor by 20 million with your kids . @entity1 : it does , yeah . except now my son 's turning 13 , and he 's like , \" you 're really nothing like @entity5 , are you ? \" @entity0 : does he use that to attract girls ? @entity1 : this is very weird , but on some level , i 'm kind of a wingman for my son , who 's turning 13 . this sounds very politically incorrect , but it 's weird because most of the time , he does n't want to talk about it with me . he does n't talk about it much ; he just wants me to be @entity188 . but i spotted him at the beach a couple years back , and he was talking to some girl who must have been 14 or 15 . i was like , \" hmm ... like father , like son . \" and all of a sudden , he 's pointing at me , and he walks over towards me . and he 's sort of walking ahead of the girl , he 's about 20 yards in front of the girl , and he 's going , \" @entity188 ... @entity5 . just give an autograph , will you ? \" and i was like , \" ok . \" @entity0 : you sealed the deal for your son ! @entity1 : for my then - 11 - year - old son ! i know ! if you see me in bars in about 10 years time , stop me ! @entity0 : does the process of bulking up ever get tedious ? i mean , there 's muscles everywhere . @entity1 : i 'll be honest with you , i kind of love it ; i love the challenge of it . my personality is , ' i have to be in better shape than the last time . \" ... i feel really blessed to have the role , and i want to do it better every time , and so for me , the physicality of @entity5 is everything . i 've realized it 's preparation , it 's time . like in some of the old movies , you could see i did n't have time to prep . and i 'm 44 now , so i need the time . @entity0 : how much time did you spend getting ready ? @entity1 : three hours a day . i had a mentor , @entity222 , the @entity223 . we 're mates , and i said , ' mate , i need to know what you do . \" and he said , \" tell me you 've got six months ? ... you need six months to do this . \" he told me the diet -- 6,000 calories -- ( and that ) you have to train like no one else . @entity0 : what does 6,000 calories a day consist of ? @entity1 : it 's six meals , with each meal having some kind of protein -- chicken , steak , fish , eggs -- a lot of it . brown rice . if you 're lucky enough , as you 're bulking , you get brown rice or sweet potato . and then in the last month , i cut all the carbs out , and then it 's a lot of steamed veggies . it 's pretty plain , there 's no salt , very little seasoning . and that 's the big that gets hard . this is what i learned : when i started , i used to think , \" you want to be bigger ? you want to be in better shape ? train harder , train harder , train harder ! \" it 's not not ( that ) , it 's the food . seventy percent of the way you look is your diet , 30 % is your training . so if there 's anything you 've got to concentrate on , it 's the food . @entity0 : when you 're done , what 's the first thing you go for ? @entity1 : lasagna , ice cream , desserts , pizza ... all that stuff . @entity0 : that 's probably one of the happiest days \n"
